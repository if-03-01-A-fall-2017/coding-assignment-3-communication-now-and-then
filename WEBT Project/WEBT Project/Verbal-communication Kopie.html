    <h1>
      Difference Between Verbal And Nonverbal Communication
    </h1>

    <p>
      Verbal and nonverbal are all types of communication, but the difference between them is that we use our voice in verbal communication and we use body signs in nonverbal communication.
      Verbal and nonverbal communication are interconnected and they operate together in communication.
      People are using around 35% verbal communication and 65% nonverbal communication in daily life .
      Nonverbal communication has also cultural meaning.
    </p>

    <h1>
      Verbal Communication
    </h1>
      <p>
        Verbal communication refers to the use of sounds and language to relay a message.
        It serves as a vehicle for expressing desires, ideas and concepts and is vital to the processes of learning and teaching.
        In combination with nonverbal forms of communication, verbal communication acts as the primary tool for expression between two or more people.

        The two basic types of verbal communication are interpersonal communication and public speaking.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Public Speaking
      </h2>
      <p>
       The public speaking involes one or more people delivering a message to a group.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Interpersonal communication
      </h2>
      <p>
       The interpersonal communication generally refers to a two-way exchange that involve both talking and listening.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Purpose
      </h2>
      <p>
        Verbal communication has many purposes, but its main function is relaying a message to one or more recipients.
        It encompasses everything from simple one-syllable sounds to complex discussions and relies on both language and emotion to produce the desired effect.
        Verbal communication can be used to inform, inquire, argue and discuss topics of all kinds.
        It is vital to teaching and learning, as well as forming bonds and building relationships with other people.
        Although all species communicate, language itself is a purely human phenomenon that allows for more precision than the communication methods of other beings.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Challenges
      </h2>
      <p>
        A variety of challenges may arise when using verbal communication to express oneself.
        Misunderstandings can arise because of poor word choice, differing perspectives and faulty communication techniques, and subjective opinions regarding acceptable language may result in breakdowns in communication.
        Language barriers are a major cause of confusion when attempting to communicate verbally.

        According to the University of Louisville, differences in language influenced by geographic location, education and social status can create barriers even among those who speak the same language.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Solution
      </h2>
      <p>
        Difficulties with verbal communication canÂ´t be completely avoided,
         but it is possible to increase your chances of communicating succesfully.
        Consider the message you wish to communicate before speaking and communicate with respect for the recipient's point of view.
        Pay attention to what you say and how you say it. Speak clearly and enunciate your words and be conscious nonverbal aspects such as eye contact, posture and facial expressions.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Everyone has a unique style of communicating and perceiving messages.
        Although verbal communication is a primary means of expression, nonverbal actions such as body language can greatly affect the way a message is perceived.
      </p>

      <h1>
        Nonverbal Communication
      </h1>

      <p>
        Nonverbal communication is the communication without words.
        Noverbal communication is a process of communication through sending and receiving wordless messages.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Power Of Nonverbal Communication
      </h2>

      <p>
        Nonverbal communication is the most powerful form of communication.
        More than voice or even words, nonverbal communication helps to create your image in
        others mind and even you can express your emotions and feelings in front of others,
        which you are unable to express in words.

        Posture and how you carry your self tells a lot about you.

        Personal Space
      </h2>

      <p>
        Personal space is your "bubble" - the space you place between yourself and others.
