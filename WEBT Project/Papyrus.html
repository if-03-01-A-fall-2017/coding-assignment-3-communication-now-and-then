    <h1>
      The Papyrus
    </h1>

    <p>
      Papyrus (plural papyri), was the most important contributor to the written culture of antiquity.
      The papyrus served at fist in ancient Egypt and later throughout the ancient Mediterranean a similar
      function in writting as does paper for China's literate culture, then Islamic culture, and finally the Western world.
      In contrast, in the Ancient Near East, with the exception of Egypt, unbaked clay tablets with cuneiform writing
      were the most important basis of the written form.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Papyrus â€“ Herstellung und Geschichte
    </h2>

    <p>
      Papyrus was actually called pa-per-aa in ancient Egypt. The translation is quite simple: The king had the monopoly
      for the production of the papyrus plant. Therefore, the word is composed of pa (possession) and per-aa (pharaoh) - possession of the pharaoh.
      The Greeks turned it into papure that became "papyrus". Incidentally, our word "paper" also derives from the word.
    </p>

    <h2>
      The History Of Papyrus
    </h2>

    <p>
      We do not know exactly today, when the first papyrus sheet was created .
      A blank roll of papyrus was found in a grave from the first dynasty (about 3032-2853 BC).
      The oldest papyrus with characters dates from the 4th dynasty and was discovered in 2013 in Wadi el-Jarf on the Red Sea.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Why The Papyrus Plant
    </h2>

    <p>
      The ancient Egyptians have always worked on herbal writing materials only with papyrus.
      The reason for this is due to the nature of the papyrus plant.
      Each plant has different hardness and moisture levels.
      Some are full and fibrous inside, but most reed trees are hollow inside.
      Even our native reed grass is hollow and consists of individual segments.
      Each segment begins and ends with a knobby in the stem. The papyrus plant is an exception.
      It has a full stalk core and grows straight without bumps and is sometimes almost 3 feet high,
      if you let it grow. So enough material for the production of many papyrus rolls.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Indispensable for administration and foreign policy
    </h2>

    <p>
      The papyrus plant was one of the most important components of the ancient world for over 4000 years,,
      indispensable for administration and foreign policy.
      It was easier to write on papyrus than on heavy clay tablets and he was above all better transport.
    </p>

    <h2>
      But expensive and not very resistant
    </h2>

    <p>
      The disadvantage, however, was that it was not as robust as e.g. Stone, leather, wood, clay, etc.
      and that he was relatively expensive.
      In the Middle Ages, papyrus was therefore replaced by cheaper Japanese pulp paper and papyrus production was increasingly forgotten.
      There is no record of the manufacturing process, so we were able to find out what papyrus production
      most likely looked like by examining old papyrus rolls and then trying it out.
    </p>

    <h2>
      The production of papyrus
    </h2>

    <p>
      1. From the harvested plants, the outer shell was first peeled off.
      <br>
      2.The marrow was cut into thin strips which were placed several times in a water bath for soaking and then tapped flat.
      This procedure was repeated until narrow, almost transparent stripes emerged.
      <br>
      3.After the last water bath, the papyrus strips were laid side by side over a length of about 40 cm, so that they slightly overlapped.
      Then put another layer across this row.
      <br>
      4.Using a mallet, the strips were patted and pressed together until a solid leaf emerged from the released sap that acted as an adhesive.
      <br>
      5.This sheet had to be laid under a heavy stone for several days to dry.
      <br>
      6.With a sharp stone, a shell or a piece of wood, it was finally smoothed so that the writing pen did not hang while writing.
    </p>

    <h2>
    Boats, fuel, sandals - all purpose weapon papyrus
    </h2>

    <p>
      Papyrus was not only used for papermaking. Due to the high wood deficiency in Egypt, the plant was also used as a kind of wood substitute.
      From the root of the Egyptians made fuel and all kinds of equipment, from the stems were built boats.
      The inner bark was used to make threads from which mats and baskets were woven and braided.
      Shoes were also made from the plant.
      In addition, the papyrus plant was still on the diet of the ancient Egyptians and served as a remedy for wounds and ulcers.
